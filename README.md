# ✋ AirDraw — Real-Time Hand Tracking Drawing App

AirDraw is a browser-based hand tracking application that lets you **draw in mid-air** using your webcam or phone camera.  
It uses [MediaPipe Hands](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker) for real-time hand tracking, detecting your pinch gesture to start and stop drawing.
